# LifeUp (Single Person Project)

#Overview
Lifeup is an iOS application that revolves around habit tracking and productivity. Many of us have the desire to accomplish large goals but refuse to complete 
the small tasks in the present. By accomplishing our small goals continously everyday for a long period of time we may find that the large goal doesn't seem
to difficult to accomplish. LifeUp is capable of tracking your customized goals which will provide scores based on performance and habit streak. In order to 
learn how to walk, we must first learn how to crawl.
